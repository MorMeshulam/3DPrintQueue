This project contains a client server app for handling printer queue.

 ### React + Redux and Resux Saga with NodeJs server with REST API and SocketIO integration.

 ## The Project
 - this project originally created for printers but can be used for any other subject.
 - the project built from scratch and has minimum depandecies.
 - we use react-script to run tha app but you also have webpack preperd folder.

 ## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://youtu.be/BsBYhcM4bDA

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo

- Running the client
- `npm install` or `yarn` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

- Running the server
- under `/server` run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)
- you can alse run it from base directory (client) with `npm run server` or `yarn server`
 Local web server will use port 4001 
 
### Making requests to the backend API
you will have open REST API at `http://localhost:4001/api/queue`
If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit 
`src/config/secrets.js` and change `NODE_SERVER` to the local server's URL (i.e.)

**General functionality:**

- Get queue data `/api/queue`
- Add queue item `/api/queue/add`
- Delete queue item `/api/queue/delete`
- Cancel queue item `/api/queue/cancel`
- Reorder queue item `/api/queue/reorder`
- Load test items into queue data `/api/queue/test`

### Optional:  Persist Queue Data

- you can run your server in persist mode
  and all data will be stored localy and restored every wake up.

  just uncomment //queueDb.bindWithStorage(socket);
  on file `/server/services/socket.io.worker.js`

  *you maybe will need to add some adjusments and check for runtime bugs 
  
  ### User Load Testing and Simulate

- you have the ability to create bulk of queue items
  from the navigation bar on the app (with icon of LAB)
  just click on the icon and a modal with 2 fields will open.
  
  - first field is the number of queue items you want to push to the queue.
  - second field is a hash operator to make each item's duration different.
  for instance if you choose :
  number of items: 10
  hash duration code: 5
  the result will be:
  
  item 1: duration : 1*5 = 5sec 
  item 2: duration : 2*5 = 10sec 
  item 3: duration : 3*5 = 15sec 
  ..........
  item 10: duration : 10*5 = 50sec 
  
  ### `run bulk load test` from code
 
  you can alse use this capability straight from code  <br>
  under the queue model `/server/model/queue.js` -> this.test({...})

**Real World and production considerations:**
- Authentication between client and server
- Webpack integration for better bundle management
- Add more logs and test (Jest etc.)
- Use storybook (or else) for better ui and component tests.
- Code beutification
- Add local or remote DataBase for handle the queue data.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
